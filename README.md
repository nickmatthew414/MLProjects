# MLProjects
Notebooks I worked through with the Hands-On ML textbook

Earlier chapters implemented algorithms in sklearn like SVMs, RandomForests, Gaussian Mixture Models, etc.
Later chapters implemented a range of neural net architectures in Keras and Tensorflow's lower level APIs

Chapter 18 explored a variety of RL algorithms
